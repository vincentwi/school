Takeaways from Ralph's code: 
1. Degree of influence is measured by how often and how recently a donor has donated 
2. Recency and frequency do play an important  role in distinguishing high retention customers 
3. Individuals with no donation record are designated to be non-responsive donors 
4. Only donors that solicited are the ones who we need to consider for scoring 
5. Segmentation helps to chuck out donors who appear to be loyal but actually are not (BOTTOM WARM)
6. The degree of their influence to the donation amount can be weighted to give a new order of influence (Suggest EWMA) 
7. Average return can help, but it might be prone to unequal weights (Suggest 6)
8. If the donor is active in the top 10 active campaigns, then the donor is bound to donate anyways (Good sign of loyalty) 

Suggestions: 
1. Look into response ratio (Donation frequency/Campaign Frequency) 
2. Donors with a response ratio higher than 1 can be classified as "High target donors" (Though this needs to be looked into) 
3. Seasonal spikes or the type of donation does not make a difference, so it can be discarded 
4. We can also label "fresh donors" as those who donated extremely recently (Less than 1 year's time span) 
5. Look at the scoring for the next year 
6. Look at the months that are having a high frequency of campaigns and donations

Example: I donate in March & June, and they see the same patterns in the previous years, and then we can use this 

Look at donors who donate monthly and label them as "High response" donors 

For each donor, we look at their behaviour and see their monthly behaviour 

-> Solicitate or not: Customer value 
-> No. of messages to send 
-> Allocate messages to different campaign ID based on seasonal behaviour of users
