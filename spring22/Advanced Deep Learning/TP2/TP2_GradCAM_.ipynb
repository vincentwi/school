However we hardly know how and why it works, due to the lack of decomposability into individually intuitive components. In this assignment, we use Grad-CAM, which highlights the regions of the input image that were important for the neural network prediction.\n",

    "* **Overview:** Given an image, and a category (‘tiger cat’) as input, we forward-propagate the image through the model to obtain the `raw class scores` before softmax. The gradients are set to zero for all classes except the desired class (tiger cat), which is set to 1. This signal is then backpropagated to the `rectified convolutional feature map` of interest, where we can compute the coarse Grad-CAM localization (blue heatmap).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **To Do**: Define your own function Grad_CAM to achieve the visualization of the given images. For each image, choose the top-3 possible labels as the desired classes. Compare the heatmaps of the three classes, and conclude. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hints**: \n",
    " + We need to record the output and grad_output of the feature maps to achieve Grad-CAM. In pytorch, the function `Hook` is defined for this purpose. Read the tutorial of [hook](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/former_torchies/nnft_tutorial.html#forward-and-backward-function-hooks) carefully. \n",
    " + The pretrained model resnet34 doesn't have an activation function after its last layer, the output is indeed the `raw class scores`, you can use them directly. \n",
    " + The size of feature maps is 7x7, so your heatmap will have the same size. You need to project the heatmap to the resized image (224x224, not the original one, before the normalization) to have a better observation. The function [`torch.nn.functional.interpolate`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.functional.html?highlight=interpolate#torch.nn.functional.interpolate) may help.  \n",
